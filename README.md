Project Abstract:


1.Care Advisor App

More than half of the american population suffer from some sort of chronic diseases including diabetes. While this health problem can be controlled through lifestyle and medication, following a health care plan is not feasible to manage on a daily basis. It requires the patients to get a hands on advice from the therapist or doctor about what to do and what no to do. With the large scale of patients reaching out to doctor for such advice, this care advising process for millions of people has become difficult using the conventional technology, until cognitive engagement technology comes into the picture.
The “Care Advisor App” using this technology can programmatically learn about the individual patients and their lifestyle, food habits etc and customize their care accordingly. This “Care Advisor” app will collect those behavioral data of patients and provide the medical and lifestyle suggestions pertaining to each individual patients in real time all through the smart phone. Through machine learning the system customizes the user experience and provides the suggestions for the right thing to eat a right health behavior at the point of decision making by the patient. Thee activities can also be shared with the doctor himself which will keep him informed about the well being of his addressed patients. Care giver(the doctor) can access the up to date snapshot of the patient and generate timely updates, warnings , alerts for each individual.So rather than collecting data at the time of patients visits, the advisor can talk about only wellness all the time.
The impact of consolidating the large data and tracking it could be huge, but with this “Care Advisor” application the advisor would be able to manage a large at-risk population and patients could reach health targets faster leading to a better quality of life for all.

3.Employee  Professional Development Tracking System
Many employees forget to fill the timesheet and complete the mandatory training before the deadline. It is difficult for a project manager to follow up with employees to get it done on time.
Employee  Professional Development Tracking System includes a collection of information regarding the behavior of the employee such as time taken by an employee to complete the assigned task,  efficiency of an employee towards assigned tasks ,meeting the deadlines to complete the assigned tasks. How frequently employee needs an external resource such as google search while working on assigned task, keeping track of missing deadline while submitting a timesheet. By tracking all the above-mentioned parameters our system will help employee towards the improvement of his weaknesses. Our system will understand the type of Google search done by the employee and suggest the training to improve the skill set. This will help to reduce dependency on external resources also to expedite the process of completing work prior to the deadline.  The system will also notify the employee frequently about filling the timesheet on a periodic basis. The system will use various pattern matching algorithms and do analytics of all the data gathered to provide timely suggestions, notifications, and recommendations to the employee. The system will thereby, help the employee improve skills and keep a track of his professional growth.
